Message passing is the same thing as a function call in other traditional (procedure based) languages.  
This term is used to emphazise that objects are used in Object Oriented Languages.  When a method call occurs such as object.method(),
it is to be considered that the message method() is sent to object. When the object receives the message, it invokes the method.  
Messages can acquire parameters to perform some storage or calculation on.
